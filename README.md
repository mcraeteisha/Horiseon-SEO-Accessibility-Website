# Horiseon-SEO-Accessibility-Website
This Horiseon SEO website meets accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.

We want the internet to be as accessible to as many people as possible. That’s why it’s important that websites meet accessibility standards. I was hired by Horiseon Social Solution Services to refactor their website code, making it more accessible. 
 
For Horiseon, another benefit of refactoring their website code is that their site is now more optimized for search engines. The easier it is for search engines, such as Google, to crawl and understand a webpage, the higher a page will rank in relevant searches.

## Work Completed

To complete this project, I used the asset files that the company provided, including HTML, CSS, and image files.

Using VS Code, I updated the HTML provided as follows:
* Swapped out generic elements for semantic elements
* Added alt attributes to all images
* Updated non-working links


I made the following changes to the CSS:
* Combined repetitive styling to make CSS simple and easy to digest
* Added comments to explain some of the styling
 
## Learnings
 
This project required some independent learning and also allowed me to apply classroom lessons to a real-world scenario.

Some of the learnings I’m taking away from this project are:
1. The importance of accessible websites
2. What it means to refactor code
3. What Semantic HTML is and how to use it
4. How to create README files
